# cripto_test_task
Your task is to build a simple React app using bitcoinjs library. It's up to you what other libraries you choose, but we require some form of clean state management (i.e. Redux or context) and eslint (config is up to you). Create an application with two different routes (using actual navigation).  The first route is supposed to collect some form of user input (completely up to you if that's text input or mouse movements). The user input is then passed to the second route (but not via url), and the second route displays Bitcoin private key, legacy address (P2PKH), segwit address (P2WPKH) and their QR codes.  Imagine the app is supposed to run on a very old smartphone, so generate the addresses in a way it doesn't block rendering and show a loading screen while they are being generated.  If you have no idea how to generate a Bitcoin address, don't worry. You can find how to generate both P2PKH and P2WPKH addresses in documentation / examples of bitcoinjs lib. https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib
